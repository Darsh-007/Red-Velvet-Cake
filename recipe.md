INSTRUCTIONS
Mix the yogurt with all the spices, corn flour, ginger-garlic paste, and some salt. Add the vinegar only if your yogurt is not sour.
Add the chicken pieces to this and mix well.
Refrigerate this mixture for about 2 hours to let the marinade work its magic on the chicken pieces. You can also leave it overnight in the refrigerator
When you are ready to fry, heat the oil in a kadai or pan. The amount of oil should be enough to almost cover the pieces so the quantity required will depend on your pan.
Gently add the marinated chicken pieces one by one without overlapping and fry on a medium-low flame until golden brown, turning every once in a while. The outside should turn a dark golden brown otherwise the meat wonâ€™t be cooked through.
The chicken pieces will shrink a bit on frying as the moisture leaves the meat. The sizzling of the oil will also die down almost completely.
Do a quick taste test and remove from the oil. Drain on paper towels as you fry the next batch. Add the curry leaves when you are frying up the last batch and let it turn crisp.
Drain and add curry leaves to the fried pieces of chicken. Give everything a quick stir and serve hot with lemon wedges and raw sliced onions
